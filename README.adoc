== Crunchy Watch
v0.0.1, {docdate}

image::docs/crunchy_logo.png?raw=true[]

Crunchy Watch is an application that watches a PostgreSQL master
and looks for a failure, at which point it will perform
a failover scenario.

Failover scenarios are extensible.  Sample failover scenarios are
provided including:
 * trigger a failover on a random replica
 * trigger a failover on a replica using metadata labels

=== Build Prerequisites

Crunchy Watch is packaged into a Docker container which can
execute in a pure Docker 1.12, Kubernetes 1.5.1, and Openshift 3.3
environments.

You can also run Crunchy Watch outside of a container as a binary.

1) Installing / configuring Docker

On an EL7 system, docker can be installed with the following commands:

 * sudo yum -y install docker
 * sudo groupadd docker
 * sudo usermod -a -G docker ${USER} 
 * sudo systemctl enable docker;systemctl start docker
 * TIP:  remember to log out $USER for the docker group to take effect!

2) Building the Container (Optional)

If you don't want to pull the container from link:https://hub.docker.com/u/crunchydata/[DockerHub], you can perform a build of the container locally 
on your development host.

The provided Dockerfiles build the container in two configurations:
 * base Centos7 image with the community PostgreSQL RPMs installed
 * base RHEL7 image with the Crunchy PostgreSQL RPMs installed

Start the build by performing the following:

....
mkdir -p $HOME/wdev/src $HOME/wdev/bin $HOME/wdev/pkg 
export GOPATH=$HOME/wdev
go get github.com/tools/godep
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p src/github.com/crunchydata
cd src/github.com/crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-watch.git
export BUILDBASE=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-watch
cd $BUILDBASE
godep restore
make build
make dockerimage
....

Crunchy provides a commercially supported version of this container
built upon RHEL 7 and the Crunchy supported PostgreSQL.  Contact Crunchy
for more details at link:http://www.crunchydata.com.

=== Examples

Various examples are provided in the /examples directory and described
in the documentation for running Docker, Kubernetes, and Openshift examples..

To run the examples, you will need to set the CCP_IMAGE_TAG
environment variable which indicates which version of the 
container you will pull down and execute, for example:
....
export BUILDBASE=$HOME/crunchy-watch
export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-9.6-1.2.8
cd $BUILDBASE/examples
....

The BUILDBASE is the location of where you cloned the containers github
repository.

The CCP_IMAGE_TAG is the version of the container you want to test
with.  That version is out on Dockerhub.

All examples live under the examples directory.
