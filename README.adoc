= Crunchy Watch
v1.8.0, {docdate}

image::docs/crunchy_logo.png?raw=true[]

== Overview

Crunchy Watch is an application that watches a PostgreSQL master
and looks for a failure, at which point it will perform
a failover scenario.

Failover scenarios are extensible.  Sample failover scenarios are
provided including:

 * trigger a failover on a random replica
 * trigger a failover on a replica using metadata labels
 * trigger a failover on a replica that is further ahead than others

Crunchy Watch is packaged into a Docker container which can execute in a pure
Docker 1.12, Kubernetes 1.7, and Openshift 3.6 environments.

You can also run Crunchy Watch outside of a container as a binary.

Crunchy provides a commercially supported version of this container built upon
RHEL 7 and the Crunchy supported PostgreSQL.  Contact Crunchy for more details
at link:http://www.crunchydata.com.


== Usage

Crunchy Watch is designed to operate on multiple platforms. Therefore, it is
necessary to specify the platform at startup.

`$> crunchy-watch <platform>`

Supported Platforms:

[options="header"]
|===
| Name       | Value
| Kubernetes | kube
| Openshift  | openshift
|===

*Example:*

`$> crunchy-watch kube`

=== Options

All options can be configured via a command-line flag or an environment variable.

Flag values will take precedence over values defined by an environment variable.

There are general options that apply across all platforms. As well, each
platform provides their own specific options. The details for each are provided
below.

== Build

Building `crunchy-watch`, supporting plugin modules and docker image are
accomplished using `make` and the provide Makefile.

=== Requirements

 * Go 1.8 or greater
 * Docker 1.12 or greater
 * Kubernetes client (kubectl) 1.7 or greater
 * https://www.openshift.org/download.html[Openshift client (oc) 3.6] or greater
 * https://github.com/Masterminds/glide[Glide 0.12] or greater

*Note:* The `$> make setup` target (below) will retrieve the requisite kubernetes and
openshift client binaries.

=== Centos Build Steps

These steps assume your normal userid is *someuser* and 
you are installing on a clean  minimal Centos7 install.

==== Install Docker

....
sudo yum -y install docker
sudo groupadd docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker someuser
newgrp docker
docker ps
....

==== Install Build Dependencies

....
sudo yum -y install gettext git golang
....

==== Setup Project Settings and Structure

....
export GOPATH=$HOME/odev
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src $GOPATH/bin $GOPATH/pkg
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
export CCP_BASEOS=centos7
export CCP_PGVERSION=10
export CCP_PG_FULLVERSION=10.2
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-watch.git
cd crunchy-watch
....

==== Get Project Dependencies

....
go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
glide update
make setup
....

==== Build from Source

....
make
....

==== Build the Docker Image

NOTE:  To build the RHEL based image, you will need the Crunchy
repo keys to be copied to the $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-watch directory.   This is because the RHEL image is based on the 
Crunchy RPM packages.
....
cp CRUNCHY-GPG-KEY.public  $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-watch
cp crunchypg*.repo $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/crunchy-watch
....

....
make docker-image
....

=== Targets

[options="header"]
|===
| Target | Description
| all
	| (*default*) calls `clean`, `resolve` and `build` targets
| build
	| builds `crunchy-watch` binary
| modules
	| builds all plugin modules
| kube-module
	| builds kubernetes plugin module
| openshift-module
	| builds openshift plugin module
| clean
	| cleans all build related artifacts, including dependencies.
| resolve
	| resolves all build related dependencies
| docker-image

	|`CCP_PG_FULLVERSION` and `CCP_VERSION` to be defined.
| setup

|===

== Extending Crunchy Watch

Crunchy Watch is designed with extension of its function and supported
platforms in mind.

=== Extending by Plugin

Crunchy Watch makes use of the golang plugin package. Therefore it is possible
to build support for new platforms separate from each other.

To integrate with the plugin system the following interface must be met:

....
type FailoverHandler interface {
	Failover() error
	SetFlags(*flag.FlagSet)
}
....

`Failover()` is called to process the failover logic for the platform that the
plugin supports.

`SetFlags(*flag.FlagSet)` is called immediately after the plugin is loaded.
This allows for plugin to define options/flags that are unique to its
operation.

As well, it must be built with the `-buildmode=plugin` option. See an example
of this in the project link:Makefile[Makefile]

=== Extending by Hook

Crunchy Watch provides both a `pre` and `post` failover hook. These hooks will
be executed in a shell environment created by the `crunchy-watch` process.
Therefore they can be any executable or script that can be called by the user
running the `crunchy-watch` process.

To configure the execution of these hooks, a fully qualified path to the
executable or script must be provided by either the `--pre-hook` or
`--post-hook` flags.  Or by defining the `CRUNCHY_WATCH_PRE_HOOK` or
`CRUNCHY_WATCH_POST_HOOK` environment variables.

*Example:*

....
$> crunchy-watch kube --pre-hook=/tmp/watch-pre-hook
....

Or,

....
$> CRUNCHY_WATCH_PRE_HOOK=/tmp/watch-pre-hook crunchy-watch kube
....

== Examples

Various examples are provided in the `examples` directory and described in the
documentation.

To run the examples, you will need to set the `CCP_IMAGE_TAG` environment
variable which indicates which version of the container you will pull down and
execute, for example:

....
$> export CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-10.2-1.8.0
$> ./run.sh
....

Or,

....
$> CCP_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-10.2-1.8.0 ./run.sh
....
