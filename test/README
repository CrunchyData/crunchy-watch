disable.sh can be used to disable a pod.
kubectl cp disable.sh pr-primary:/tmp
kubectl exec -it pr-primary /tmp/disable.sh

It works by changing the name of PG_VERSION to PG_VERSION.BAK
postgreSQL will not start in that state.

Then sending a TERM signal to postgres. This will cause the pod to 
terminate and subsequent starts will fail.
